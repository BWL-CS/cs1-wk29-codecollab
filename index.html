  <h1>CodeCollab Wk29: JavaScript + Webpages</h1>
  <strong>Focus on the JavaScript code for this discussion, but you may need to refer to the HTML code
    too!</strong>

  <p class="description">This week's CodeCollab discussion should focus mainly on the JavaScript code, but make connections to relevant parts of the HTML and the CSS files as well! HINT: Pay attention to class names...</p>

  <p>
    <span class="vocab">Variables</span>
    - A storage location paired with an associated "identifier" (the variable's name or label 🏷️), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information (referred to as a "value"). DECLARING a variable involves using a special keyword, either <code>let</code> or <code>const</code>. ASSIGNING a value to a variable is done with a single equals sign ( = ). Variables are like boxes 📦 that store data 🧠
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="vocab">Statements</span>
    - Instructions/commands 👉 that are executed by the web browser. A JavaScript statement can be a simple or complex operation that performs an action, such as assigning a value to a variable or calling a function. Statements always end with a semicolon ( ; ) like a stop sign 🛑, whereas "code blocks" (functions, loops, conditionals) open up curly brackets ( { } ) like a section. 
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="vocab">Functions</span>
    - Reusable blocks of code that execute specific tasks (instructions) when called (activated). Functions can take inputs (known as "parameters") and can provide outputs (known as "return values") that can be stored as variables. Functions are like recipes 📝, parameters are like ingredients 🥣, and return values are like a resulting meal 🍲. 
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="vocab">Loops (for, while)</span>
    - Loops allow for a block of code instructions to be repeated 🔁. FOR loops are useful when the number of iterations (times the loop runs) is clear before entering the loop...like in this program, where JS already "knows" how many elements to repeat the instruction for. <em>Can you find this in the JavaScript code?</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="vocab">Conditionals (if, else)</span>
    - Conditional blocks are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Conditional expressions are like questions 🤨 that have a answer of either "true" or "false". Using conditional expressions with if-else statements allows the code to make decisions about executing certain parts of the code...like in this program, where JS only removes the highlight class IF the element has it. <em>Can you find this in the JavaScript code?</em>
